    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a thick, rich butternut squash soup with tons of flavor. Something I whipped up off the top of my head,
        with things I had on hand. Super easy, quick, and a great way to use squash. An instant hit at my house.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium potatoes, cubed</li>
        <li>1 medium butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed</li>
        <li>1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat, and cook onion, celery, carrot, potatoes, and squash until
            lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in enough chicken stock to cover vegetables.

        </li>
        <li>Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer until all vegetables are
            tender, about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer soup to a blender and process until smooth. Return to the pot and mix in any remaining stock to
            reach desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
